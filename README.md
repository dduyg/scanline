# Pure CSS Single Element Link Styles

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/MatthewShields/pen/WOEBPG](https://codepen.io/MatthewShields/pen/WOEBPG).

These have been made to specifically be a single element link - use of pseudo but no wrapping spans here. Pure CSS approach. Going to keep updating and browser testing them too.
